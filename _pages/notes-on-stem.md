# ðŸ§ª Notes on STEM
This page contains notes related to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).

To transition into medical physics with a foundational background in science or engineering at the undergraduate level, one should have a solid understanding of the following STEM subjects:

### Covered or at least mentioned in standard undergraduate physics
- Mathematical methods in physics
  - Partial differential equations, Greenâ€™s functions, and variational methods. Special functions like Legendre, Bessel, and spherical harmonics appear often but usually in pre-tabulated or numerically evaluated forms.
  - Hassani is good for a general overview and advanced details. Numerical methods books like Press are more practical.
- Computational methods
  - Monte Carlo simulation (e.g., Geant4, FLUKA) for radiation transport, finite element methods for solving EM field problems, and numerical techniques for dose calculation (e.g., pencil beam, Monte Carlo dose engines).
  - For practical applications, open-source toolkits and software manuals are often more useful than standard textbooks.
- Quantum mechanics
  - Knowledge until second quantization(so called advanced quantum mechanics) is enough, most problems in MP deal with things at fine structure of atomic level like spin-orbit couple and relativistic corrections. QFT is not necessary unless have to calculate exact reaction cross section in nuclear physics.
  - Griffiths, Sakurai is fine for beginner, refer to Cohen-Tannoudji for details.
- Eletrodynamics
  - Calculation of EM field(most problems does not have analytic solution involved with complex analysis and werid special function, have to do finite element method) and relativly charged particle dynamics. QED is still uncessary but no harm if you are really interested in calculation of Feynman diagram.
  - Begin with Griffiths, advance to Jackson/Zangwill.
-Nuclear physics
  - Basic nuclear models (liquid drop, shell model), nuclear reactions, decay processes, and detector principles.
  -Martin and Krane are good starting points. Tina Potterâ€™s slides provide clear explanations and useful insights. For more details, refer to Blatt & Weisskopf for formal scattering theory.
  
### New things perhaps
- Radiation physics
  - Electron, photon, neutron interaction with matter. Concepts of KERMA, LET, 
  - Turner and Nikjoo are helpful, refer to Podgorsak for details.
- Detection of radiation
  - Principles of radiation detection, including gas-filled detectors, scintillators, and semiconductor detectors. Concepts like energy resolution, efficiency, dead time, and statistical uncertainty are crucial. Pulse processing and spectroscopy methods are also important for practical applications.
  - Knoll is the standard reference.
- Physics of radiotherapy
  - Metcalfe is good.
- Physics of medical imaging
  -CT, MRI, PETCT, etc.
-Radiobiolgy and radiation protection
