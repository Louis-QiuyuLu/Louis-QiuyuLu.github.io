# Pathways to Clinical Medical Physics for STEM Undergraduates (Australia & USA)

## Australia

The pathway to becoming a clinical medical physicist in Australia follows a structured and competitive process:

1. **Obtain an ACPSEM-accredited Master's Degree in Medical Physics**
   - A master's degree in medical physics from an **ACPSEM (Australasian College of Physical Scientists & Engineers in Medicine)** accredited program is required.
   - Some candidates pursue a PhD for stronger academic credentials.

2. **Enter the TEAP (Training, Education, and Assessment Program) Registrar Program**
   - TEAP is the clinical training pathway required to become a certified medical physicist.
   - Admission is highly competitive, and many successful applicants have a PhD or even postdoctoral research experience.
   - The program typically takes **3 years** and involves structured clinical training under supervision.

3. **Qualify as a Certified Medical Physicist**
   - After completing TEAP, candidates become **ACPSEM-certified medical physicists** and can practice clinically.

## USA

In the United States, the process is regulated by the **American Board of Radiology (ABR)** and follows these steps:

1. **Earn a CAMPEP-Accredited Graduate Degree in Medical Physics**
   - A master's or PhD degree from a **CAMPEP (Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Educational Programs)** accredited program is required.
   - A PhD is often preferred for competitive residency placements.

2. **Complete a Medical Physics Residency Program**
   - A **two-year clinical residency** in an accredited program is required for board eligibility.
   - Residency programs are highly competitive, and some applicants enter through alternative pathways (e.g., postdoctoral fellowships with clinical components).

3. **Pass the ABR Certification Exams**
   - The **ABR (American Board of Radiology) exams** consist of three parts:
     - **Part 1**: General medical physics and clinical foundations (can be taken after a graduate degree).
     - **Part 2**: Specialty-specific clinical physics knowledge (after residency training).
     - **Part 3 (Oral Exam)**: Comprehensive assessment of clinical competence.
   - Board certification is essential for practicing as a qualified medical physicist in the US.
