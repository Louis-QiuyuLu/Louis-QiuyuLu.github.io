# üë®‚Äçüî¨ About me
I am now pursuing a master's degree in medical physics at UoW. During my undergraduate studies, I participated in a research project related to quantum sensing and served as an undergraduate research assistant in the laboratory. After graduating, I shortly pursued a master's study in Germany for one semester, but had to discontinue due to the COVID-19 pandemic and visa issues. Subsequently, I worked as a mathematics and physics tutor at an educational institution. Currently, I have transitioned to the field of medical physics and aspire to further my studies and research in this area.

My research interest includes medical radiation physics. I have published papers at the top journals with total <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=abcd1234"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Scholar-View%20Profile-blue?logo=Google%20Scholar"></a>.
