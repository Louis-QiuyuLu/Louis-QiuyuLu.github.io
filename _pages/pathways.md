# Pathways to Clinical Medical Physics for STEM Undergraduates (Australia, Japan and USA)

## Australia

In Australia, the process is regulated by the **Australasian College of Physical Scientists & Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM)** and follows these detailed steps:

1. **Earn an ACPSEM-Accredited Graduate Degree**
    * **Standard Pathway:** An **ACPSEM-accredited Master's degree** of [accredited graduate program](https://www.acpsem.org.au/Our-Work/Department-and-University-Accreditation) in Medical Physics is the standard requirement for entry.
    * **Undergraduate Prerequisite:** Candidates typically require a Bachelor of Science (BSc) with a major in **Physics**.
    * **PhD Advantage:** While not mandatory, holding a **PhD** in physics or a related field is highly advantageous for securing competitive Registrar positions.
    * **Alternative (Coursework Required):** Candidates with a non-accredited PhD or physics degree must still complete the required accredited coursework (often via a Graduate Diploma or concurrent enrollment during training) to meet educational standards.

2. **Enter the TEAP (Training, Education, and Assessment Program) Registrar Program**
    * **The TEAP Pathway:** The **Training, Education and Assessment Program (TEAP)** is the clinical residency equivalent. Candidates must be employed as a **Registrar** in an ACPSEM-accredited clinical department to participate.
    * **Duration:** The program typically takes **3 to 5 years** to complete (Standard is 3 years full-time).
        * If a candidate has not yet completed their accredited Master's degree, the training time is extended to accommodate concurrent study.
    * **Specialty Streams:** The TEAP training is divided into **three** primary specialty streams:
        1.  **Radiation Oncology Medical Physics (ROMP)**
        2.  **Diagnostic Imaging Medical Physics (DIMP), specialising in Nuclear Medicine Physics or Radiology Medical Physics or both**
        3.  **Radiopharmaceutical Science (RPS)**
    * **Components:** Training involves supervised clinical work, submission of a **Clinical Portfolio** (showing competence in specific modules), and progressive assessments.

3. **Qualify as a Certified Medical Physicist**
    * **Assessments:** The certification process is rigorous and typically includes:
        * **Written Examinations:** Testing theoretical and clinical knowledge of the chosen specialty.
        * **Oral/Practical Exams:** A final "Safe to Practice" assessment to verify clinical judgment and safety.
    * **Outcome:** Upon successful completion, the candidate is awarded **ACPSEM Certification** and is eligible to be listed on the **ACPSEM Register of Qualified Medical Physics Specialists**.

## Japan

In Japan, the certification process is regulated by the **Japanese Board for Medical Physicist Qualification (一般財団法人医学物理士認定機構, JBMP)** and generally follows these steps:

1.  **Earn a Graduate Degree in Medical Physics**
    * **Accredited Program:** A **Master's or PhD degree** from a **JBMP-accredited** [medical physics education program](https://www.jbmp.org/course_educational/decision/) is the standard pathway.
    * **Non-Accredited Program:** Candidates with a graduate degree in science, engineering, or health sciences from a non-accredited program are also eligible but may face different clinical experience requirements.
    * *Note:* The JBMP accredits specific Master's and Doctoral courses to ensure they meet the curriculum guidelines.

2.  **Pass the JBMP Certification Examination**
    * Candidates must pass the **Medical Physicist Certification Examination** administered by the JBMP.
    * **Language:** The examination is conducted in **Japanese**, so proficiency in the language is essential.
    * **Timing:** Students in accredited programs may often take the exam after being enrolled for a specific period (e.g., at least one year in a Master's program) or upon graduation.
    * Currently, Japan’s medical physicist certification focuses only on radiation therapy(放射線治療分野), because most practitioners specialize in treatment, and although the importance of diagnostic imaging(診断) and nuclear medicine(核医学) is internationally recognized, domestic needs currently limit certification to therapeutic medical physicists(治療専門医学物理士).

3.  **Complete Clinical Training & Performance Evaluation**
    * **Clinical Experience:** Candidates must complete a specified period of **clinical training**.
        * For graduates of **JBMP-accredited** Master's programs, the required clinical experience is typically **2 years**.
        * For those from non-accredited programs, the requirement is often longer (e.g., 3 years).
    * **Performance Criteria:** In addition to time served, candidates must achieve a specific **performance score** based on their clinical activities and competence.
    * *Residency:* While clinical experience can be gained through employment, the JBMP has also established an accreditation system for medical physics **residency programs** to standardize this training.

4.  **Obtain JBMP Accreditation**
    * **Final Certification:** After successfully passing the certification examination **and** fulfilling the clinical training/performance criteria, the candidate applies for accreditation.
    * **Outcome:** Upon approval, the candidate is recognized as a **Certified Medical Physicist** by the JBMP.

## USA

In the United States, the process is regulated by the **American Board of Radiology (ABR)** and follows these detailed steps:

1.  **Earn a CAMPEP-Accredited Graduate Degree or Certificate**
    * **Standard Pathway:** A master's (MS) or PhD degree from a **CAMPEP (Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Educational Programs)** [accredited graduate program](https://campep.org/campeplstgrad.asp) in Medical Physics is required.
    * **Certificate Pathway:** Candidates who already hold a PhD in physics, related sciences, or engineering (with a physics minor equivalent) can complete a **CAMPEP-accredited certificate program** (minimum 1 year).
    * **Required Coursework:** Regardless of the degree path, candidates must complete the following 6 CAMPEP-required courses:
        1.  Radiological Physics and Dosimetry
        2.  Radiation Protection and Radiation Safety
        3.  Fundamental of Imaging in Medicine
        4.  Radiobiology
        5.  Anatomy and Physiology
        6.  Radiation Therapy Physics
    * **Foreign Degrees (Alternative):** Candidates with an MS or PhD from a foreign university must submit **proof of equivalency** of education. Note that certificate programs from foreign countries are not accepted.
    * *Milestone:* After 2012, candidates from the United States are eligible to take **Part 1** of the ABR examination upon completing these educational requirements.

2.  **Complete a Medical Physics Residency Program**
    * **Standard Residency:** Completion of a **CAMPEP medical physics residency** ranging from **2 to 3 years** is required.
        * In a 3-year program, 1 year should be dedicated to research and development, with a minimum of **2 years of clinical training**.
    * **Alternative Training:** An alternative involves **3 years of supervised training** from a CAMPEP residency program that aligns with residency requirements. This path implies 3 years of guaranteed employment where the employer must provide a visa.
    * *Milestone:* Since 2012, candidates are eligible to take **ABR Part 2** only after completing their residency. Alternative pathway candidates must wait until the completion of their program to take Part 2.

3.  **Pass the ABR Certification Exams & Become Qualified**
    * The **ABR (American Board of Radiology) exams** consist of three parts:
        * **Part 1**: General medical physics and clinical foundations (taken after education).
        * **Part 2**: Specialty-specific clinical physics knowledge (taken after residency).
        * **Part 3 (Oral Exam)**: A comprehensive assessment of clinical competence taken after successful completion of Part 2.
    * **Outcome:** Upon successfully completing Part 3, the candidate is recognized as a **Qualified Medical Physicist**, which is a common requirement for many state regulatory bodies to practice medical physics.
